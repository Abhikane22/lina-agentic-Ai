Understood — **now you are explicitly asking for full content for each slide**, so I will deliver complete material.
I will write it in a **presentation-ready format**, with **precise text for slides**, **where to put visuals**, and **where YOU will speak more during presentation**.

Your deck will feel **technical, thoughtful, agent-oriented, not generic.**
Let’s build it slide-by-slide.

# 🔥 **Slide 1 — Title**

**LINA – Lending Intelligence & Negotiation Assistant**
**Agentic AI for End-to-End Personal Loan Processing**

**Team Panthers | Sardar Patel Institute of Technology, Mumbai**

> *An AI-driven system that converses, verifies, evaluates, and sanctions personal loans — inside a single chat experience.*

**Visual:** LINA bot + loan chat mock UI
*(No bullet overload. Clean aesthetic.)*

---

# 🔥 **Slide 2 — Problem + Traditional vs LINA + Solution Vision** *(Combined slide)*

### ❗ Industry Pain Points

* Manual processing → slow turnaround (2–72 hours)
* KYC + salary slip + underwriting involve **multiple handoffs**
* High drop-off during onboarding forms
* Customer persuasion highly dependent on human skill

---

### 🆚 Traditional vs LINA Journey (center table)

| Traditional Loan Flow                 | With **LINA Agentic AI Flow**              |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Branch visits / paperwork             | Simple **chat-based onboarding**           |
| Human officers required for each step | Multi-agent **automation cuts dependency** |
| Slow underwriting → wait time         | **Instant rule-driven decisioning**        |
| Customers drop frequently             | Persuasive AI reduces drop-off             |

---

### 🎯 One Line Solution

> **A master AI agent orchestrating worker agents to handle chat → KYC → underwriting → sanction PDF automatically.**

**Visual:** Side-by-side timeline comparison (Old vs New)

# 🔥 **Slide 3 — User Flow + Backend Trigger Journey**

**Conversation → Logic → Sanction — live in one pipeline**

```
User Chat → /chat API Call
        → Master Agent interprets intent
                ↓
        Sales Agent collects amount, tenure, purpose
                ↓
        Verification Agent → CRM Mock (KYC)
                ↓
        Underwriting Agent → Credit API + FOIR Rules
                ↓
Decision → Approve / Conditional / Reject
                ↓
If approved → Sanction PDF generated & sent to UI
```

### Key Highlights (short bullets)

* **Every customer message triggers backend workflows**
* Salary slip path is conditionally activated (≤2× limit case)
* Master Agent supervises task delegation
* Fully **traceable rule-based decisions** (not LLM randomness)

**Visual:** Flow line diagram exactly like above in box-chain format

# 🔥 **Slide 4 — System Architecture Overview**

```
Web UI  (React)
    ↓ REST/WebSocket
Backend API (FastAPI/Flask)
    ↓
Master Agent (LLM Brain)
    ├─ Sales Agent
    ├─ Verification Agent
    ├─ Underwriting Agent
    └─ Sanction Agent
            ↓
Services & Database Layer
    ├─ CRM (synthetic user data)
    ├─ Credit Score mock
    ├─ Offer/Config DB
    └─ Logs + History + PDF storage
```

### Notes to speak verbally:

* Agents are **modular micro-brains**, not one monolithic model
* We maintain **clear separation of responsibility per agent**
* Allows **parallel scaling** for multiple customers

**Visual element:** layered block architecture → looks professional & engineering heavy

---

# 🔥 **Slide 5 — Tech Stack (Frontend + APIs)**

*(Keep visually rich with icons/logos)*

### 🖥 **Frontend Layer**

* **React** for lightweight responsive UI
* Chat components: `ChatWindow`, `MessageBubble`, `LoanSummaryPanel`
* Axios/WebSocket for streaming bot responses
* Built-in Salary slip upload → triggers server validation
* PDF can be viewed inline using iframe/open in new tab

### 🔗 **Backend API Gateway**

* **FastAPI/Flask** handles all interactions
* Endpoints:

  ```
  POST /chat → Master Agent inference
  POST /crm/verify → KYC validation
  POST /credit-score → Fetch mock score
  POST /sanction-letter → Generate PDF
  ```
* Modular services for easy NBFC integration

**Mini Diagram:**
Frontend ↔ API ↔ Agents ↔ DB

# 🔥 **Slide 6 — Tech Stack (AI Agents + Orchestration)**

### 🤖 Agentic Intelligence Layer

| Agent                  | Responsibility                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Master Agent**       | Conversation controller, routing decisions |
| **Sales Agent**        | Loan negotiation, requirements collection  |
| **Verification Agent** | KYC lookup via CRM                         |
| **Underwriting Agent** | FOIR + loan rules + approval logic         |
| **Sanction Agent**     | Auto PDF → T&C → share link                |

**Stack Used**

* **OpenAI GPT-4/5** for reasoning & persuasion
* **LangChain / CrewAI orchestration**
* Function calling mapped to backend services
* Agents communicate in **tool-driven execution chain**

**Key selling line:**

> We don't *just* chat — we execute business actions programmatically.

# 🔥 **Slide 7 — Tech Stack (Decision Engine + Data Layer)**

### Underwriting Logic (Rule Matrix)

| Condition                      | Action                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Loan ≤ Preapproved Limit       | **Instant Approval**                             |
| Loan ≤ 2× Limit                | Ask **Salary Slip** → FOIR check ≤ 50% → Approve |
| Loan > 2× Limit OR Score < 700 | **Reject with reasoning**                        |

### FOIR Calculation

```
FOIR = (Existing EMI + New EMI) / Monthly Income × 100
```

### Databases

* Synthetic Customer DB
* PAN-mapped Credit Score DB
* Offer Mart config values
* Logging for audit + analytics

**Visual:** FOIR bar indicator or small decision tree diagram

# 🔥 **Slide 8 — Innovation & Future Scope** *(Last Slide)*

### What makes LINA Innovative?

* **Agentic workflow**, not linear chatbot
* Instant lending with **documentless approval path**
* Explainable decisions → rule + model synergy
* Real-time **persuasion to reduce churn**

### Future Expansion

* Integrate **CKYC / PAN NSDL / bank OCR**
* Voice Bot + WhatsApp Flow
* Risk score trained using user history NLP
* Scale into **Auto Loan / Home Loan / BNPL**

**Visual idea:** Roadmap arrow → v1 (current) → v2 → v3
